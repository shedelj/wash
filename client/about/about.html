			WASH Records is based in Santa Cruz, California and was formed in 2014 by UCSC students Jesus Villegas and Hessed Porras. Starting as a club on campus with the help of Ben Barsocchini and Katie Sweeney slowly, more musicians started to get involved and it began to serve as an outlet for all types of music such as: Alternative-Rock, Electronic, Folk, Hip-hop, and many more. Shortly, the club then transitioned into a record label with the intention of expanding and building a bigger, stronger community to facilitate all types of collaborations.
