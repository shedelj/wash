				<h4>Artist Spotlight: Phair</h4>

						<p>	In this month’s feature, we talk to one of our LA Based artist’s, Callie Ryan(22) aka Phair. In this short interview, Phair gives us an insight on her music. </p>
						<p> Q&A: </p>
						<p> Q: So, tell us about how you started your project? </p>
						<p> A: “I started this project about two years ago. Growing up and listening to animal collective I began to wonder about why these type of sounds were moving to me. I noticed that it wasn’t just the gravity and weight of these sounds that were moving me physically but, it was more about the raw and aggressive energy that made my feel that way. My goal in this project is to take familiar rhythms that are associated with hip hop and trap and re-appropriate them and combine them with heavily glitched and manipulated vocals and found samples. </p>
						<p> Q: Besides music, are there other elements that you would consider as inspiration for your music? </p>
						<p> A: “I feel like that there aren’t enough woman in the electronic field with these sounds. So I wanted to make sure that I can create an environment where I can explore the possibilities in communicating with my raw emotions in a tangible way that can make your gut feel the aggressiveness. I want to be a part of the movement for strong female electronic musicians that aren’t afraid of making people feel uncomfortable.” </p>
						<p> Q: We are excited in hearing your new EP, do you want to talk to us about that a bit more in detail? </p>
						<p> A: “This EP has been a learning experience for me because I am doing all the production. As a result, I believe this contributes to the idea of making my sound more human because it is also about the struggle of me trying new things. This EP is also about me exploring with hip hop beats and instrumentals because I am collaborating with members from the LA based rap collective Ubiquitous Love Tribe. </p>
						<p> Q: Can we get a sneak peak on the title of your EP? </p>
						<p> A: “Yes!, its going to be called Phlesh weight. The reason for the EP title “Phlesh weight”, is because I am trying to address the disconnect that many of us have between our external structure and being aware of our own fleshy bodies and the emotions that we create within that. I think it is very important in making yourself vulnerable in any type of art that you are making. In this EP, I am making myself very vulnerable in the way that I am expressing my emotions and experiences in a raw and transparent manner. </p>
						<p> Q: Do you have a specific place in mind where you want to take your music? </p>
						<p> A: “I want to immerse myself in the LA beat scene and hopefully collaborate with people in that community and as a result learn more about myself and sound”. </p>
						<p> WASH Records is excited in releasing Phair’s EP, Phlesh weight in August 2015. Stay tuned! </p>
